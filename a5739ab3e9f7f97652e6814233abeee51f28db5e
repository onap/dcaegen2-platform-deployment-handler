      "message": "excellent question !\n\nhere it is important to differentiate the returned value of \n1. null \u003d\u003d policy is not listed in the filters of the policy-update message, so we do not want to remove this policy from deployment\n\n2. versus actual boolean false \u003d\u003d policy is listed in filters of the policy-update message, but the there is no intersection between the deployed filters and the filters in the policy-update message - the case when the policy matching to the filter changed and the policy does not match to the filter anymore \u003d\u003e we need to remove that policy from deployment.\n\nhmmm - it looks like i would need to fix the counter-part in policy-handler to always have at least an empty policy_filter_matches for the policy_id when the deployed policy was matching to filter, but the updated policy does not anymore",
